# What is SharePoint Application Pool Changer? #

This small utility is exclusively for administrators to change the Application Pool of SharePoint web application. SharePoint 2010 doesn't allow us to change the IIS Pool directly from  IIS Manager as it stores the mapping information in its configuration database because it uses that mapping in administrative jobs. So there was a challenge and custom code is required to change the application pool in SharePoint web applications. This utility helps in creation of IIS Pools and also is assignment of existing pools for SharePoint Web Applications.
